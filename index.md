2. **TOP priorities.** Production database without inactive historical data generates all types of benefits such as better user experience and expensive resource savings. These are the top priorities of DBArchive solution;
3. **Resources.** DbArchive intentionally was developed to be simple yet powerful solution which uses as minimum resource as possible in client side;
4. **Demo.** Solution demo contains related 23 tables filled with random data sets. By provided “2 years and older” archiving filter and after completed first iteration we can see **increased database execution performance by 99% and database storage space gained by 99%;**
5. **Results.** All presented numbers are related to my workstation hardware specifics. These specifics are listed in the last section of <a href="DbArchive.pdf" target="_blank">white paper at page 21.</a>
