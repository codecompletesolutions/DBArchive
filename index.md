> Hey, do you want improve your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture" target="_blank">3-tier application</a> performance  by up to 99% and save huge (up to 99%) amounts of expensive storage? I bet – yes, so download and read this <document> sections #1, #2 about how Database Archiving solution “DbArchive“works.

> Want to know more about what additional Busines Values you can get from this solution? No problem, look at the same <document> section: DBArchive Delivers Business value on page 19.

> And you more likely want a real thing, not papers – we think the same. I’ve recorded DBArchive solution demo for you. So, do not wait any longer, click and see how everything plays together.  Demo: <link>

Quick reference:
1. DbArchive solution stands for dynamic, granular historical data move process (archiving) and improved global application performance. More solution capabilities could be found here, in section Overview and page 3;
2. In Production and without inactive historical data all benefits like user experience or expensive resource savings etc improves too. These are the top priorities of DBArchive solution;
3. DbArchive intentionally was developed to be simple yet powerful solution which uses as minimum resource as possible in client side;
4. Prepared demo contains related 23 tables filled with random data sets. By provided “2 years and older” archiving filter and after completed first iteration we can see increased database execution performance by 99% and database storage space gained by 99%;
5. All presented numbers are related to my workstation hardware specifics. These specifics are listed in the last section of documentation.

> All bits of DBArchive solution are looking forward.
